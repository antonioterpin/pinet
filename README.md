This repository contains a [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) implementation of &Pi;net, an output layer for neural networks that ensures the satisfaction of specified convex constraints.

> [!NOTE] TL;DR
> &Pi;net leverages operator splitting for rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function theorem for backpropagation. It offers a *feasible-by-design* optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems to obtain modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems.

## Benchmarks üìà
Below, we summarize the performance gains of &Pi;net over state-of-the-art methods. We consider three metrics:
- Relative Suboptimality ($\texttt{RS}$): The suboptimality of a candidate solution $\hat{y}$ compared to the optimal objective $J(y^{\star})$, computed by a high-accuracy solver.
- Constraint Violation ($\texttt{CV}$): Maximum violation ($\infty$-norm) of any constraint (equality and inequality). In practice, any solver achieving a $\texttt{CV}$ below $10^{-5}$ is considered to have high accuracy and there is little benefit to go below that. Instead, when methods have sufficiently low $\texttt{CV}$, having a low $\texttt{RS}$ is better.
- Learning curves: Progress on $\texttt{RS}$ and $\texttt{CV}$ over wall-clock time on the validation set.
- Single inference time: The time required to solve one instance at test time.
- Batch inference time: The time required to solve a batch of $1024$ instances at test time.

We report the results for an optimization problem with optimization variable of dimension $d$, $n_{\mathrm{eq}}$ equality and $n_{\mathrm{ineq}}$ inequality convex constraints and with a  non-convex objective. Here, we use a small and a large (in the parametric optimization sense) datasets $(d, n_{\mathrm{eq}}, n_{\mathrm{ineq}})  \in \{(100, 50, 50), (1000, 500, 500)\}$.

Overall, &Pi;net outperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy and training times.
